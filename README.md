# About this React app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task

1. Move the Heading function from App to a separate component file, named "Heading.js"
2. Import the Heading component into the App component
3. Remove the sentence that reads: *This is the starting code for "Your first component" ungraded lab* - so that only the Heading JSX element remains in the return statement of the App component.
